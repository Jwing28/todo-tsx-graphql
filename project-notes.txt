My notes for the project: 

KISS..

Functionality (phase 1)
- Able to add todo 
- Able to remove todo 
- Able to mark todo complete.

Components 
Todo app always has a header and an input and a button. 
As todos are added it expands.
Todo area has fixed height-width and will scroll when too many to view at once

Todo Container 
    header 
    input + button for submit form 
    state lives at top
